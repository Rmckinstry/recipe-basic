    <li>Heat remaining vegetable oil over high heat. Stir in garlic, and cook for a few seconds until garlic begins to turn brown.

        Add red and green bell peppers, dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons rice wine, and sugar. Bring to a boil and stir in chicken mixture. 
        Cook until peppers are nearly tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more.
